Collection of scripts and tweaks to make Ubuntu 18.04/19.04/19.10 run smooth on Dell XPS 15 9570.
I suggest everyone to use the post install method, the respun ISO is no longer supported nor neeeded for booting Ubuntu on 9570 as the stock one contains the needed fixes.

All informations, tips and tricks was gathered from:

## Post-install script
If you already have a standard Ubuntu install, you can try applying basic tweaks with the `xps-tweaks.sh` script.
You can run it directly without cloning the repository with the following command (requires `curl`):
```shell
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtorressahli/dell-xps-9570-ubuntu-respin/master/xps-tweaks.sh)"
```

If you want touchpad gestures using X11, check https://github.com/bulletmark/libinput-gestures or better https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma.

## How to switch from one graphic card to the other
Starting from nVidia 435 drivers, we can finally offload apps like on Windows without having to use very complicated setups with Bumblebee.
If during the script you chose to not enabling offloading, you can use the classic `prime-select` command:

**Intel**:
```
sudo prime-select intel
```
**Nvidia**:
```
sudo prime-select nvidia
```

**Note: A full reboot could be required when switching graphic cards.**
